Case Study: Reinforcing Trust in Store Visit Attribution for Location-Based Advertising

Business Problem
  
In the high-stakes world of location-based advertising, campaign ROI hinges on conversion KPIs like clicks and—most critically—physical store visits. 
The company identified major data quality gaps affecting visit attribution, leading to inconsistencies and unexplained reporting spikes. 
These anomalies risked client trust and posed threats to long-term relationships by undermining the integrity of our “visits” metric, a key competitive moat.

Role & Solution
  
As a Data Analyst, I delivered actionable insights and transparent KPI tracking through a custom internal Looker dashboard for Product Managers (PMs). 
I designed a robust monitoring system that:

	•	Tracked daily visit trends under the legacy and new attribution pipelines, letting PMs review deviations in real time.
	•	Included breakdowns by tenant and campaign, enabling granular impact analysis and proactive client communication if anomalous spikes occurred.
	•	Featured an adoption-rate monitor for campaigns transitioning to the new visit attribution workflow, promoting company-wide alignment.
	•	Integrated a status log for each pipeline component—making errors, delays, or system failures immediately visible.
	•	Embedded easy-to-understand metric definitions and calculations to ensure every stakeholder grasped KPI meaning and usage.
  

This dashboard empowered PMs to monitor every facet of project success, fostered rapid adoption of high-quality attribution processes, 
and enabled effective troubleshooting through transparent, easy-to-interpret charts and logs.

Results & Impact

While primarily a foundational initiative, the project successfully stabilized store visit metrics, reduced fraud, and strengthened client trust. 
The Product Manager praised the dashboard for its clarity, speed, reliability, and its critical role in proactive monitoring.

Tools & Techniques

	•	Python for data manipulation and pipeline integration
	•	AWS cloud data sources
	•	Looker for dashboarding and visualization
